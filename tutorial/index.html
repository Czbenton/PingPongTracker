    <title>Play Slick Template - Activator Template</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
      <p>You've just created a simple Play Framework application with the Slick library! 
        <br/>
        This template will help you building a classic Web app or a JSON API.</p>
      <h2> View the App</h2>
      <p>
          Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at: <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
      </p>

      <h2>Slick Usage</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
  In order to enable schema generation you can specify the packages or classes you want to have in the application.conf file.
  The default value is : <pre> slick.default="models.*"</pre> 
  <br/>
  It follows the same format as the Ebean plugin: slick.default="models.*" means all Tables in the models package should be run on the default database.

  It is possible to specify individual objects like: slick.default="models.Users,models.Settings"
  </div>

  <div>
  The DB wrapper provided by play-slick is just a thin wrapper that uses Slick classes with databases defined in the Play Application . 

  To see an example, check the Application.scala file from this template.

  Using "import play.api.db.slick.Config.driver.simple._" will import the driver defing with the key "db.default.driver" in application.conf, or the one set by the test helpers in test mode (see tests in this template as an example).
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Execution context configuration</h3>
  </div>

  <div>
  You may want to use a separated execution context to avoid blocking threads in the default thread pool. Play-slick provides a DBActionto handle this.
  This thread pool configuration is available in application.conf (see the slick-context settings)  
  </div>

  <div>
    If you need to use more advanced use cases (example : more than one database driver per mode (run or test)), please read the <a href="https://github.com/playframework/play-slick/wiki">play-slick wiki</a>.
